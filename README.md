Android Fine Tuner
=========================

There was a little thing that bothered me: when you are about to release your app, there are some twicks to be done:
fine tining colors, margins and more. This requires recompilation, uploading to the device, navigating to the desired screen just to change `1dp`.
That's a log of time!

This tool will allow you to do it instantly, you just add that one class to your project, pair your device with the local wifi network. and you can change all those small things instantly!
