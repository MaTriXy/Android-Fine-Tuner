Android Fine Tuner
=========================

There was a little thing that bogart me: when you are about to release you app, there are so many some twicks to be done:
fine tining color, margins and more. This requires recompilation, uploading to the device, navigating to the desired screen just to change `1dp`.
That's a log of time!

Usage:
=========================

1. Copy the `FineTuner.java` to your project
2. Call `FineTuner.registerActivity(this)` in the `onCreate()` of your activity
3. Install the [Fine Tuner Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/android-finetuner/iefbhbepcgnkdebmokindfeiolmoocca) for Google Chrome
4. Open the app and Enter the `local ip` of your android device

Demo:
